It is my project i started 2 months before it was done by team work about the website YUGAVITRAH is a food donation platform dedicated to connecting those in need with individuals and organizations willing to donate food. The website aims to reduce food waste and combat hunger by providing a seamless way for donors to contribute surplus food to people and communities facing food insecurity. YUGAVITRAH facilitates the collection and distribution of food donations, ensuring that every meal reaches those who need it the most. By fostering a community of generosity and compassion, YUGAVITRAH empowers individuals to make a tangible difference in the fight against hunger.
